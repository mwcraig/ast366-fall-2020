    "\n",
    "Different time scales (like UT1 and TAI) have days that correspond to diferent amounts of time, so when a Julian date is used it should be made clear what time scale it is on.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important time scale, UTC, should NOT be converted directly to a Julian date because the number of seconds in a day in UTC depends on the day. Most days it is 86,400 but the is one second longer or shorter on UTC leap second days.\n",

    "\n",
    "The JD has a couple of oddities:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The day starts at noon, not midnight.\n",
    "+ There have been over 2.4 million days since the designated start of the Julian date system, so it is easy to unintentionally round a Julian date when it is represented in a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modified Julian date (MJD) is the Julian data minus 2,400,000.5. The decimal part shifts the MJD to begin at midnight instead of noon, and subtracting off 2.4 million makes it easier to represent the date on a computer.\n",
